Use it with your video mixer to display live translation during live event broadcasts.\r\n\r\n## Version 1.01\r\n* Added saved translations feature in a simple text file\r\n* Edit /public/txt/texts.txt\r\n* Autodeploy to heroku\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/tailorvj/litr8r/tree/1.01)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI've written it for use in live Internet broadcasts I produce, on YouTube Live, Facebook Live and other platforms that suppot RTMP\r\n\r\n## Local Installation\r\n\r\nClone the project to a node.js server, cd into project folder and run npm install to install all dependencies. \r\n\r\nrun node index to run the server and CTRL+C to stop it. \r\n\r\n## Heroku deployment\r\n\r\nAutomatic deployment is available using the following button\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/tailorvj/litr8r/tree/1.01)\r\n\r\nIf you like using the heroku toolbelt installed, simply create a new heroku app, add a web dyno and deploy via git push heroku master.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n[Input](https://thawing-reaches-20064.herokuapp.com/input).\r\n\r\nUsage: \r\n\r\n* Arrow up twice and Enter to start (due to a current bug. will be fixed soon)\r\n* Arrow Up to load next saved phrase into editing area\r\n* Arrow Down to load previous saved phrase into editing area\r\n* Enter to submit to output\r\n* Preview available at the top which you type\r\n* Output monitor available at the bottom\r\n\r\n[Output](https://thawing-reaches-20064.herokuapp.com).\r\n\r\nUsage: run in full screen and remove background color using chroma key in your video mixer\r\n\r\n## Translation workflow\r\nThe app consists of two main screens: Input and output. \r\n\r\nInput is on http://servername:5000/input\r\n\r\nUsage: \r\n\r\n* Arrow up twice and Enter to start (due to a current bug. will be fixed soon)\r\n* Arrow Up to load next saved phrase into editing area\r\n* Arrow Down to load previous saved phrase into editing area\r\n* Enter to submit to output\r\n* Preview available at the top which you type\r\n* Output monitor available at the bottom\r\n\r\nOutput is on http://servername:5000\r\n\r\nRun output window in full screen and connect to a video mixer with Chroma key support. Use Chroma key to remove green background and mix with video input. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nCurrently the project is in prototype stage. Hence, there are no tests. You should open http://server:5000 to see the translator input and in another browser window open http://servername:3000/output to see translation output. each message sent from the input page should also be seen in the console and info about clients connecting/disconnecting.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nTODO: add currentl screenshots\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n@tailorvj\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGPL v3\r\nPlease give credit for subtitles softwaer to Tailor Vijay in your broadcasts",
