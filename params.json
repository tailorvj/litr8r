  "body": "## Synopsis\r\n\r\nlitr8r is a live translation software with chroma key (green screen) background for live event broadcast mixing. Use it with your video mixer to display live translation during live event broadcasts.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI've written it for use in live Internet broadcasts I produce, on UStream and on other platforms. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nClone the project to a node.js server, cd into project folder and run npm install to install all dependencies. \r\n\r\nrun node index to run the server and CTRL+C to stop it. \r\n\r\n## Heroku deployment\r\n\r\nIf you have the heroku toolbelt installed, simply create a new heroku app, add a web dyno and deploy via git push heroku master.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n[Output](https://tranquil-anchorage-5276.herokuapp.com/).\r\n\r\n[Input](https://tranquil-anchorage-5276.herokuapp.com/input).\r\n\r\n## Translation workflow\r\nThe app consists of two main screens: Input and output. \r\n\r\nOutput is on http://servername:5000\r\n\r\nInput is on http://servername:5000/input\r\n\r\nRun output window in full screen and connect to a video mixer with Chroma key support. Use Chroma key to remove green background and mix with video input. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nCurrently the project is in prototype stage. Hence, there are no tests. You should open http://server:5000 to see the translator input and in another browser window open http://servername:3000/output to see translation output. each message sent from the input page should also be seen in the console and info about clients connecting/disconnecting.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![litr8r prototype input screen](http://tailorvj.github.io/images/20150406-litr8r-input-heroku.jpg)\r\n\r\n![litr8r prototype output screen](http://tailorvj.github.io/images/20150406-litr8r-output-heroku.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n@tailorvj\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGPL v3\r\n",
